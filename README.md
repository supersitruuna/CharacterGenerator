# Character Generator
A character generator for the Pathfinder tabletop RPG. With this generator a user can generate themselves a randomized character including a race, a class, an alignment and a motivation that drives the character. A user can randomize just one of these characteristics at a time or do all at once. The UI is also optimized for mobile.
